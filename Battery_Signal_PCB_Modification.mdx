# Arrow PT3 Battery Signal PCB Modification

## Why

The Signal PCB has a little fault in the layout of the can circuit. A small modifcation is needed to make the can circuit work as expected. This fault in the pcb layout was causing the problem we encountered when we wanted to enable the contactor via a can bus message during the may meetup in texas.

## Problem

Pin 7 on the Arduino MKR 1010 is used as a CS Pin for the SPI interface which is not obvious when looking at the official pinout. The Freelancer did not use the standard pins with the can bus circuit which led to the issues we experienced. Pin 7 was assinged as the SPI CS pin and also as the CS pin for the MCP2515.

## Modification

Use Arduino Pin 6 instead of Pin 7 for CS of the MCP 2515.
