# Arrow PT3 Battery Signal PCB Modification

## Why

The Signal PCB has a little fault in the layout of the can circuit. A small modifcation is needed to make the can circuit work as expected. This fault in the pcb layout was causing the problem we encountered when we wanted to enable the contactor via a can bus message.
