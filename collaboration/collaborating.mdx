# Inviting Collaborators

Holocron makes it easy to collaborate with team members and invite them to work on your documentation in real time. The editor provides a convenient way to invite collaborators by generating a unique link that can be shared. Collaborators can join your document using the link and contribute to the documentation with live cursor tracking, allowing everyone to see what others are doing simultaneously.

## How to Invite Collaborators

To invite collaborators to your documentation in Holocron, follow these steps:

1. Open your document in the Holocron editor.
2. Locate the circular plus button, typically found in the toolbar or sidebar of the editor.
3. Click on the plus button to generate a unique link for inviting collaborators.
4. Copy the generated link to your clipboard.

You can now share the link with your collaborators via email, chat, or any other preferred communication method. When they receive the link and click on it, they will be directed to the document in Holocron and can start collaborating in real time.

## Real-Time Collaboration and Live Cursor Tracking

Once your collaborators join the document using the invitation link, they can work on the documentation simultaneously with you. Holocron provides a real-time collaboration environment, allowing everyone to see each other's changes and edits in real time.

The live cursor tracking feature enables collaborators to see the position of other team members' cursors within the document. This visual representation helps to identify who is working on specific sections, preventing conflicts and facilitating smoother collaboration.

## Invitation Link Expiration

To maintain security and control over your documentation, the invitation link generated by Holocron has an expiration period. By default, the link expires after two days. After the link expires, collaborators will no longer be able to access the document using that particular invitation link.

If you need to extend the collaboration period or revoke access to specific collaborators, you can generate a new invitation link and share it accordingly.
