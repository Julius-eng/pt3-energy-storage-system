## Automatic Commit Messages

With each automatic commit, Holocron generates a commit message that summarizes the changes made. These commit messages provide a quick overview of the modifications and help you track the evolution of your documentation.

While the commit messages are automatically generated, it's worth noting that they may not provide detailed context for every change. For more specific or detailed information, it's recommended to include additional commit messages or comments directly within your documentation.

> Note: The frequency of automatic commits and the commit message format may be configurable based on your specific Holocron setup.
